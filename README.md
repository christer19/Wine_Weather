## Reason they selected the topic:
* We like wine , diverse dataset, enough information to pull acorss three API's. One for red and white wine , one for weather and one for soil. 

## Description of the source of data:
* Wine - https://www.globalwinescore.com/api/ 
* Weather - https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/global-summary-of-the-year

## Questions the team hopes to answer with the data:

* How does weather impact wine quality?
    * How do wine scores correlate with rain, temperature, humidity, and sunlight? Averages ? How can we use this to predict wine quality ? 
    * How does score vary by region in USA , by type ( red, white) ?
